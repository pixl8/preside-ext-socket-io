# Socket.IO For Preside

Socket.IO for Preside builds on the framework provided by the [socket.io-lucee](https://github.com/pixl8/socket.io-lucee) project to provide seamless websocket functionality right in your Preside apps. 

The extension is currently in an experimental alpha state so use at your own risk. Further documentation and guides will arrive as the system matures.
